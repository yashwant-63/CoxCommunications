This project was done as part of the MSA Project Week held during the first week of January 2022. We were tasked with coming up with solutions to tackle 4 objectives including:
1. Cluster FBC (Full Band Capture) Data
2. Identify impairments
3. Visualize most common ancestors of address network elements
4. Compress FBC data for faster access and efficient storage
